The boys and girls who were in the pongal festival mood gathered three stones and arranged them in a triangular fashion as to make it a firewood stove. Long sugarcanes were brought and they were tied and kept vertically near the stove on both sides. They collected dried sticks and kept them in the stove. A new mud pot appeared from somewhere and they washed it and decorated it with vibhuthi turmeric and vermilon powder.the sweet pongal was distributed to all in paper plates. The sweet pongal tasted heavenly even though it was devoid of the usual ingredients like cashew nut, raisins, cardamom, ghee, and milk.
