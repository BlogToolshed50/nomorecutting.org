With the increasing number of social network websites that are really disjoint from each other, things are really getting worse in managing those properly. All my friends are scattered around various networking websites and many are duplicated everywhere. Things are not really working out the way it needs to be. You can never be regular to one place and forget the others. This is bringing in serious needs for some good social networking integrator website.
