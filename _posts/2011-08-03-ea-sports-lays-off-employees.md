Recent financial issues that has come up in the country is causing major layoffs in many companies. The game company, EA which is one of the best gaming companies known as recently laid off 600 employees. This marks a 6% reduction in headcount of the number of employees at EA. This seems to be a catching trend with most of the other companies, and so it&#8217;s really a fragile situation. This division comes even when EA sports was doing a good job in selling its games across as they are one of the best game developing companies today. Everybody including me is just hoping that this situation does not continue in future too.
