It is really getting difficult to manage the numerous resources and blogs that are updated each day online. A good way of tracking the blogs you like is through RSS. It is a way of reading all the blogs form one place. I really like to Google reader, but definitely the pleasure of reading the page just on the blog is reduced by Google reader as all the information occur in the same drab interface. Things can be greatly improved if design factors of the website can be incorporated in to these rss feeds.
