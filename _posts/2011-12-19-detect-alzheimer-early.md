The recent studies, lead by the professor from the University of Michigan has given wider scope to predict the onset of Alzheimer disease. According to the study, the PET scan used for the cancer patients can safely and accurately detect the onset of the dementia. Researchers have reviewed numerous studies that combine PET, which provides functional images of biological processes with an injected bio-marker called 18F FDG to pinpoint key areas of metabolic decline in the brain indicating dementia.

This study and the findings is certain to improve the physician confidence when diagnosing a patient with dementia. However, the researcher have also said that this procedure can be difficult for the physicians especially when evaluating younger patients or those who have subtle sign of disease. The PET bio-marker 18F FDG comprises a radionuclide combined with flurodeoy glucose which mimics glucose in the body. As such, this invention will be immense use to those affected by this disease in the Asian region where it is rampant.
