Do you know that the financial institutions and the banks in particular are the worried lot about their efficiency to survive in the light of the global economic fiasco?. Yes they formulate so many parameters to measure their own efficiency in terms of profit and internal control to avoid the unpleasant situation.

The Burden Efficiency Ratio has become the most important one apart from the spread amongst the banks. In simpler terms, the burden efficiency ratio measures the level by which the non interest income is able to cover the non interest expenditure. If the ratio is on the higher side the profitability of the bank goes up.

Non interest income in any banking sector includes the commission and brokerage income and the like. Banks normally derives these income from their guarantee business and the letter of credit. That apart, they get non interest income from the service charges they levy for various other subsidiary services like processing fee on the loans, appraisal fee on the gold loans, etc,. The top management gives more thrust for such income to reduce their dependence of the interest income to boost the profit.
