Press Release:

The rules for work are changing. People are being judged differently: not just by how intelligent they are or by their training and expertise, but also by how well they handle themselves and each other.

The new rules predict who is most likely to become a star performer in their field of work and are crucial to their marketability for future jobs.

These rules have little to do with what we were told was important in school: academic abilities are largely irrelevant to this new standard. The new measure: Emotional Intelligence (EQ) takes for granted having enough intellectual ability to do our jobs. Emotional Intelligence focuses instead on personal qualities or emotional competencies based on

Self Awareness &#8211; Managing Emotions &#8211; Self Motivation &#8211; Managing Relationships &#8211; Emotion Coaching.
  
One of the most effective ways to develop Emotional Intelligence is to use the Appraisal360 Emotional Intelligence tool monitor real life behaviour. Appraisal360 specialise in providing online 360 degree feedback (multi-rater feedback) tools to support companies with the development of their staff.

Appraisal360 Emotional Intelligence uses a structured competency based questionnaire focussed around the definitions of Emotional Intelligence. Firstly, the user fills in the questionnaire with their self -perceptions. Then six people who know that person, boss, colleagues etc, are asked to fill in the same questionnaire with their perceptions of that person. The system compiles an easy to understand report which highlights strengths and weaknesses and areas where the user&#8217;s self perception differs from other people&#8217;s perception of them. It also comes with a set of learning materials to help turn the report into action. A matching support and mentoring service is also available. By using this tool you can help your staff develop their Emotional Intelligence in the workplace.
