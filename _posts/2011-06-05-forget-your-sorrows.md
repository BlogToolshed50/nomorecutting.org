Worry is a kind of fear.We must not worry in life for anything.What comes will definitely leave another day.Think of the happy times that lived and forget your sorrows.Did you ever get stomach pain or a headache before an exam or before an important event? Do you bite your nails? chew your lips? Or play with your hair because you are worried? Do you perspire heavily,find it difficult to breathe or go to the toilet many times before a special functions? Then you are a worrier.This is a great definition that I found online.Worry is looking it at this way makes it look so minuscule,imagining the worst even before it has happened is the main cause of this fear and worry. it might not strike your mind but is present at the subconscious level. We have to mentally prepare ourselves and stop worrying.
