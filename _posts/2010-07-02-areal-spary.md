Aerial spray of pesticides is undertaken in many countries by the government itself in the case of out break of certain diseases in the crop. If an extensive area is to be covered for spraying it may not be possible to do it manually. Also the time gap between covering one area and the other will lead to the spread of the disease form one place to the other before the completion of the spray for the entire area. Hence the aerial spray of the pesticide is undertaken to cover the entire area in a short span of time avoid spreading of the disease.
