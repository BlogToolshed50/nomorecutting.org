And such conversion should not have any restriction from the regulator of the country. In such a situation, the foreign assets can be converted in to local assets and vice verso according to the discretion of the holder of such currency in case full convert-ability is allowed by they said country.

In fact, the currency convert-ability enables the person to effects the payment against the current t6ransactions and capital transactions. During the course of such transaction the buying and selling price of such currency is determined by the market forces. The capital accounts convert-ability has many advantages, which includes the availability of a larger capital stock to supplement domestic resources and thereby higher growth.
