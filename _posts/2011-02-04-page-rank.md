Google weighs dual directional link more than a single link.Page rank is a measure of how good well connected your website is. The simple analogy remains that only good and genuine websites link with each other.A very good way to improve your page rank is to go ahead with quality link exchanges. It is really important that you make sure that you are able to get a reciprocal link with the blog that you are adding link to.
