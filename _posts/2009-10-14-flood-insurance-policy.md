Flood Insurance Policy was gaining momentum in USA after the hurricanes Rita and Wilma that occurred in 2005. In fact the number of such policies had increased from 385,000 in 2005 to 499,000 in 2007.It is also reported that 25 % of the policies were not renewed in the second year which were purchased after the attack of hurricane Katrina. However the economists support the subscription to the flood insurance policies as they insulate the residents against the loss that is inflicted on them and help to revive the life.
