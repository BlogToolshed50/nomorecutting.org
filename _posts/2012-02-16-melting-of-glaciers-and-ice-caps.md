It is a matter to be looked into by every environment loving person that the global glaciers are melting very fast. Do you know that, between 2003 to 2010, the global ice caps lost almost eight times the volume of Lake Erie. The study by the University of Colorado Boulder, about 150 billion tons of ice is shed by the earths glaciers and ice caps outside the region of Greenland and Antarctica annually. As a result of this phenomenon, the sea level is reported to be rising by about 0.4 millimeters annually.

As measured through the satellite by the Gravity Climate Experiment, the world&#8217;s glaciers and ice caps is found to lose 39 cubic miles of ice annually from the year 2003 to 2010. An additional 80 billion tons is also found to be released from the individual glacier and ice caps on the fringes of the Greenland and Antartica ice sheets. The climate scientists attribute this alarming situation to the human activities like pumping enormous amount of greenhouse gas. Unless the timely and correct steps are not taken by the individuals and the nations as a whole, it is going to be the peril of the world.
