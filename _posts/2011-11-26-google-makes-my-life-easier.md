Each time I want to calculate 15 * 46 , I don&#8217;t search for my calculator. But I just Google. Google has now become an integrated part of my life and I guess most of you people too. I think it is history how a single dynamic program generates so many other people. I am amazed by the development the company has achieved over the past years. I have seen Google from its infancy to its monopoly today.
