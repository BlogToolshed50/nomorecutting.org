[DONE] Unemployment world over is creating social unrest which is to be arrested at any cost. With the growing population and the rising literacy level, the people in waiting to grab a job is increasing day by day .In a developed country like the United States of America also the unemployment rate has slowly reached a level of about 5.5 % which is very much on the higher side for an economy of that size.In developing countries also the rate is on the rise .When the economy is growing at a slower phase the unemployment rate too increases rapidly .Though every government is trying to keep the level of unemployment at a minimum level the dramatic increase in the youth population over takes the speed at which the employment is generated.Self employment opportunities are also to be created by proper training to the rural youths to involve themselves in the nation building. 

The student loans as well.
