Mulching is the practice adopted to enrich the micro climatical condition in the land. it also helps to enhance the fertility of the soil. The trashes and the leaves that are falling from the trees and the crop standing in the land are forming the upper layer of the land and they provide the conducive micro climate. They also supply the needed organic manure to the land by decaying. The humidity level is altered by the deposits on the soil by way of dried leaves which forms the mulching layer.o
