Cornea is a transparent film like membrane through which the light passes.If the cornea is affected and damaged it leads to the blindness in many people.Cornea is an important part of the Eye. The other vital parts are,lens and the retina.A Doctor in Japan has developed an artificial layer which constitutes the cornea and it is under test.If it is successful,then many people can get back their eye sight easily.Replacement of cornea is now attempted by the medical world.Now they have to wait for the donors who donate their eye after death
