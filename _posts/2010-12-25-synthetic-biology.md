Synthetic Biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.
  
Why bother do this? Anything can be learned by actually doing it, by constructing it. Synthetic biology is the synthesis/ construction of living forms thereby giving us the opportunity to analyze the issue at hand from a whole different perspective. Synthetic biology is the art of remodeling life.
