I am in the computer world, and I see all my friends getting their head stuffed into the monitor all the time. It is really weird that most of them forget to even drink some water in all the work that they are into. This is really bad for health because lack of water can cause numerous ailments in the near future. Water is the elixir or life and people must understand the need for it before they decide to avoid it all together. So if you have been digging you head deep into this screen&#8230; have a breaK, go drink some water!!!
