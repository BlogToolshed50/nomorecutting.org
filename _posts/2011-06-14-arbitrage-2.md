Arbitrage is the process of simultaneous purchase and selling of the asset in different markets all over the world to get the benefit of the price variation in the said asset between one market to other one. This helps the trader to get the reasonable profit form the deal as the investment is almost nil from his side. This does not involves the actual delivery of the asset and hence they enjoy the benefit through the arbitration. Arbitration transaction is risk less as the transaction takes place simultaneously.
