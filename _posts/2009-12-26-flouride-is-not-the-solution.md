ther is a common understanding that fluorides help protect your tooth from cavities. But is that something that is truly beneficial? well removing cavities sure are but how about the fluoride that you use. There are numerous toothpaste which contain fluoride in them. But recent studies in United States and Denmark have shown a 30% reduction in the tooth decay rate with the removal of fluridated water from the water system. Also fluoride seems to have a lot of ailments attached to it. I guess this sends the appropriate signal that fluoride are not the best of solutions to cavities.
