The paycheck is not as appealing when you work in a small company as it does when you work in a large one, working in a small firm has its own advantages. If you ask me I would most probably take up a job offer with a small firm for the reasons like friendly and relaxed atmosphere,flexible work schedule,excellent potential for your own growth as the company grows,great environment for developing and implementing innovation and good recognition and much more.
