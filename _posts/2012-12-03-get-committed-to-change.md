No matter what kind of business or personal goals you are working toward you will probably have to change something about yourself in order to achieve those goals. An athlete is continually trying to change the conditioning of his/her body in order to perform at higher levels. Scholars are changing the knowledge they have in order to better pursue their academic questions. Corporations are continually changing their marketing in order to get more customers. Those of you in the network marketing industry are no different. You must be willing to change in order to move your business forward. Here are some areas in which people commonly need to change in order to move their network marking business forward.

1. Change your reading habits – First of all, you should have a regular reading habit. Salesmanship, leadership, relationship building, and spiritual books should all be on your list. If you normally read one book per month, see if you can change so that you are reading 4 books per month. Remember, that your brain will give you exactly what you tell it. Make sure that television is NOT the main source going in.

2. Change your schedule – Perhaps you need to be dedicating more time to your business. If you are currently working at your business 5 hours/week, what would it take to push it to 10 hours/week? You may have to cut out some TV time or cut back on that softball league. But in the end, isn’t it worth it to achieve financial independence?

3. Change your speech – The words you speak have incredible power over what actually manifests in your life. Make sure you are always talking positively about your life, your marriage or relationships and especially your business. Try to say your goals out load at least once per day.

4. Change your habits – If you have some bad habits, get rid of them and create some good habits. Try to take up exercise or eating more healthy foods. Make it a new habit to meet at least one new person every single day. Your list will grow fast as a result of your new habit.

5. Change your mechanics – Now may be a great time to get some advice from an up-line mentor. Go over what you have been saying to people and how you have been saying it. If you are not getting the results you want you may be saying the wrong thing. Ultimately, your repetition is more important than the technique, but it never hurts to try and get more efficient. 

6. Change your look. &#8212; It may be time to throw some of those old and out of fashion clothes away. Maybe you just need a new hairstyle or a different beard. Changing how you look will change your attitude and affect your outward personality.

So get excited about change and committed to pushing your business forward. Some people ask how much they will have to change in order to achieve the success they desire. The answer is that they will have to change as much as they have to. No one knows for sure, but in the end, if you don’t give up, you will make it.
