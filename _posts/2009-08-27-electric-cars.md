Electric cars are now on the road . In the light of the exorbitant oil price and the increase in the recurring cost of maintaining the petrol and diesel driven vehicle this has come into the market. The sale of petrol driven vehicle has come down drastically. Hence to improve the sales and to improve the profit, the car makers are now concentrating on manufacturing electric cars . These cars are driven on lithium batteries. The batteries are to be charged after running a particular distance. The speed of such electric cars are restricted to 6o miles per hour. Dutch companies are in the fore front to manufacture such vehicles.
