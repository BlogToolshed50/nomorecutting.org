When everyone is crying for the reduction of the alcohol addicts, and the reduction in the usage of alcoholic drinks, the recent data by the International Organization Of Vine and wine gives a different picture. Yes, their data there is a growth of about 0.7percent increase in the consumption of wine world around in 2010.

According to their data, as much as 242 million hectoliters of wine was consumed by the people in the world during 2010, which is more than what we took in 2009. Italy has shown reduction in the consumption.

European countries have shown some reduction while the United States has shown an increase. Countries like Germany and France remain as the top consumers of wine while the USA is recorded to be the second largest consumer of wine. Though the consumption of these within a limit helps improve the health due to the various studies, the addition to other such sedative drinks and drugs does more harm to the human being rather than bringing the good. Despite the efforts by different countries to contain the consumption, the result is not encouraging leading to various drug and alcohol related issues.
