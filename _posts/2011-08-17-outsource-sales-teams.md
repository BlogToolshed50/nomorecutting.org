Cydcor Launches Neighborhood Leaders Volunteer Program

Leading global provider of outsourced, face-to-face sales teams makes it
  
easy for sales offices to give back to their communities through new program

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. (October 22, 2008) – Cydcor, the leading provider of outsourced, face-to-face sales teams, has introduced its Neighborhood Leaders Program, a new internal program available to Cydcor’s network of sales offices. The program is designed to assist sales offices in supporting their communities through charity and volunteer work.

Cydcor’s network of nearly 200 independent sales offices located across the United States and Canada will be given financial sponsorships and encouraged to donate their time and talent to non-profit, charitable organizations in their communities. Each independent office is eligible to take advantage of Cydcor’s Neighborhood Leaders Program once annually.

“We’re proud of this new program, and Cydcor wants to support the efforts of current and new sales offices,” said Cydcor President Jim Majeski, “Cydcor believes it’s imperative to not only support the communities in which we live and work, but also to support those communities in which the sales offices thrive.”

In addition to the Neighborhood Leaders Program, earlier this year, Cydcor launched a Volunteer Day benefit for its own team members in which people are paid eight hours annually for time they spend supporting a charitable organization of their choice.

“Cydcor is dedicated to supporting team members and sales office charitable ventures and igniting interest in volunteerism, whether it’s financial or a donation of time,” said Jim Majeski, President of Cydcor. “Our goal is that this philanthropic spirit will continue to be instilled in our team members and becomes ingrained in our culture. It is simply the right thing to do.”
