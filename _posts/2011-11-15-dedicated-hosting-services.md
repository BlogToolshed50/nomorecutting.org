Red Rocks Data Center Installs Energy Efficient Cooling System

“A state-of-the-art ‘air economizer’ system further reduces Red Rocks Data Center operational costs and environmental impact.”

Morrison, Colorado &#8211; November 17, 2008: Red Rocks Data Center (RRDC), striving to become one of
  
the nation&#8217;s &#8220;greenest&#8221; data centers, recently installed an environmentally responsible cooling system. They chose a Trane Voyager (http://trane.com) unit which incorporates an outdoor air economizer that uses free
  
mountain air to cool the data center.

Installation of this cutting edge cooling system has cut RRDC’s cooling costs to one-sixth that of their previous, conventional air conditioning system. “By cutting our consumption of green house gas emitting, coal-fired electricity, we have put our money where our mouth is in regards to becoming one of Colorado’s greenest data centers while passing the cost savings onto our customers”, remarked RRDC’s managing partner, Tom Nats. RRDC was recently awarded the Bronze level in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s &#8220;Environmental Leadership Awards&#8221; for their energy efficiency. In addition, RRDC is working with the Colorado School of Mines to design a data center expansion area in the most environmentally-friendly means possible.

RRDC is hidden behind the &#8220;hog back&#8221; in Morrison, Colorado in a &#8220;frost hollow&#8221; that has abundant cool air. Housed in a former NASA satellite uplink facility, the center now draws cool, filtered mountain air into the building throughout the year, virtually eliminating the need for expensive air conditioning. Tom adds, “We will also be adding duct work to capture hot server air and use it to heat our office space during the winter months. This allows us to virtually eliminate our heating costs.” Mr. Nats adds “We also offer discounts to ‘green’ groups and nonprofits.”
