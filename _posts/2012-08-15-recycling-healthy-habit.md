We know that our earth&#8217;s environment needs immediate attention, but only few are taking steps to save our planet. Our clean, colorful and bright cities also have ugly landfills and dump yards polluting our environment and living. Research shows that about sixty percent of our landfill can be recycled and it saves time, money and energy. Recycling is one of the best ways in which we can have complete usage of the products we use and act sensibly towards environment. Just throwing away trash in garbage bags or landfills does not end our waste problems.

Recycling is not a complex process; we can follow some simple steps at home or office, and be more responsible towards our environment. It is a good idea to start your recycling exercise from your home. Find some ways to reuse the resources available in your home, for example water. Check the recycling mark on each product we use and segregate the waste according to it. The main aim of your recycling program has to find beneficial ways in which you can completely utilize the product and not converting from one form of waste to another.

Natural trash items such as woods, plants and living organisms decompose in a shorter span of time [weeks or months], helping in healthy eco friendly life cycle. But, the man made items like glass, plastics, and coke-cans, takes hundreds of years to decompose causing potential danger to environment and life cycle. Thus, recycling these non-decomposable products is one of the important methods to save our environment. Governments and eco friendly agencies are taking steps to mange waste in cities and other areas to address this growing issue. However, in spite of these aggressive campaigns to promote recycling, in practice, people are less aware about it. This is because; people do not have any proper resource or ideas to help them in recycling products. Some online green communities offer various tips and practical advice on recycling, which is useful for your recycling initiatives.

Find some effective ways to reuse the product or some alternative use of the product. Sort the plastics according to their number codes for better recycling. Check the internet or some green community forums where you can find handful of information on recycling various products. These small steps and practices help us in reducing the landfill and environmental pollution and help sustainability.
