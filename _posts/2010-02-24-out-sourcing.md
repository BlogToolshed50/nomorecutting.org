Out Sourcing is the easiest way of expediting the execution of the projects.The institution per se cannot under take all the works involved in any project. It may not have the requisite expertise to do all the gamuts of the project. Hence the works that could not be handled by the organization are entrusted to certain outside agencies to complete the project on time. This will not only enables the company to complete the job on time but also reduce the cost involved . This is made possible as the investment on men and materials become very less when outsourcing is opted.
