[DONE] Non banking financial companies are the entities that are involved in the financial activities. They are permitted to take the deposits from the public and they can also permitted to lend.Central bank in a country stipulates certain regulations for such companies to operate.Share holders are given with the profit at a proportions per their investment ratio.Many banks are also becoming stake holders in such companies to gain entry in to the rural markets.
  
NBFCs are mainly involved in the field of personal loans and vehicle financing.Hire purchase financing is also entertained by the non banking financial companies extensively.In the developing countries many such companies are established to cater to the need of needy people who are kept away form the banking sector. In most of the countries major chunk of the population is not made available with the services of the banking sector.In such a condition NBFCs come to their rescue.
