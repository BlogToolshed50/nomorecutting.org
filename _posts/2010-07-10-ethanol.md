Ethanol is the component that is derived form crop like sugarcane. This is extracted from the bio waste in the sugar industry. The molasses serve as the source to get the ethanol. In view of the increase in the price of the petroleum products various countries have come out with legislation to ensure the production of ethanol in the sugar factories to mix them with petrol as a bio fuel.There is a different school of thought amongst the economists that production of ethanol as bio fuel to mix with petrol is diverting the food crop for commercial purpose affecting the food security. Hence a balanced approach is to be aimed at.
