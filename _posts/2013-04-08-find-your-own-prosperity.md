Be Loud, Proud and Purposeful!

Affirmations are the key to changing your life &#8211; saying them out loud several times a day gives them a great impact.

The way in which an affirmation works is through the subconscious. There are two ways a belief gets lodged in your subconscious &#8211; through repetition or strong emotion.

To get the result you want the affirmation has to go straight to your subconscious and become a KNOWING.

How can you do this?

You can either do that through constant repetition, which takes a lot of time, or you can attach strong emotion to the affirmation. This will take it directly into the subconscious where it goes into action to make you more magnetic to your desires. When you use repetition with emotion, the attraction powers double.

Create your own affirmation and say it over and over to get the result you want, or you could add emotion &#8211; or you could combine the two as I did.

I had one affirmation that I really liked.

&#8220;I am so grateful that I now make at least $10,000 profit every month&#8221;

I used very specific words because I didn&#8217;t want to limit myself to a certain amount of money if I could make more. I also didn&#8217;t want to have a lot of expenses which is why I used the word &#8216;profit&#8217;.

I didn&#8217;t want it to be a one-off thing, so I made sure I said &#8216;every month&#8217;.

That affirmation fitted all the criteria. It was in the present, it was personal, it had emotion, it was powerful and it had the end result clearly defined.

When I said that affirmation I really put a LOT of emotion into it. I repeated it slowly 16 times, the number of words in the affirmation.

Each time I repeated it, I put the emphasis on a different word. The first time, I emphasized the first word, the second time the second word and so on.

If you want to do this, every time you say it, you really feel the emphasized word in your heart and soul.

Flood your entire body with the emotions you would feel if the affirmation was already true.

And close your eyes as you repeat the affirmation and see it as already having happened.

This is a very powerful way to give your affirmations the energy required to send them out into the universe and then speedily attract back to you your desires of abundance and wealth.
