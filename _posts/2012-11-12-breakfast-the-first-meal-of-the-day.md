The term breakfast denotes that it is the meal that breaks fast i.e. the fast during sleep. As it is the first meal of the day, we have breakfast in the morning. In the weekdays, most of the American people have a quick breakfast. But on the weekend or holidays they have a lavish traditional breakfast. On the working days the breakfast consists of coffee or any snack on the way to office. They can buy the fast food or bring it from their home. The contemporary breakfast therefore should be a quick preparation and convenient. The popular dishes of the quick breakfast list are breads, pastries, flavored cupped yogurts, fruits, instant oatmeal and granola and many more. You can also use leftovers of the previous meal to make breakfast. A more elaborate breakfast may contain fried or scrambled eggs, one kind of meat and starchy dishes. A basic combination of breakfast is starchy foods like toast, pastry, cereals, pancakes and porridge, fresh fruits and yogurts. You can also have only the starchy foods in your breakfast also.

Eggs are very popular in the quick breakfast preparation. They take such an important place in the breakfast that they are considered out of place in other courses of meals. You can have the sweeter and less spicy versions of egg offerings such as egg-filled sandwiches of croissants, hamburgers without the regular vegetable garnishes and breakfast burritos or tacos filled with eggs and cheese, often with more additions like meat or beans. A combination called country breakfast with omlette, sausage or bacon, hash browns, sausage with gravy, coffee, toast with jam or jelly and fruit juice is quite popular. There are restaurant chains in United States who specializes in the breakfast dishes like pancakes and the country breakfast. You can find the cuisine there at any time of the day. The trend of this quick breakfast is now popular in other industrialized countries of the world.
