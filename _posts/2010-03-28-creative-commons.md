I am recently involved in various types of web building works and I am in deep need of quality images for my websites. I tried finding them around places also the client company does not offer me much help thus I tend to extract them from creative commons. It is a wonderful repository of kind people who give away free stuff for people like me who run businesses at low budget. It was a nice experience scaning through their images that best suited my purpose.
