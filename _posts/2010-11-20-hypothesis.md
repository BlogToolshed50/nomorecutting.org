We were able to think of a specific problem and even came up with a hypothesis to test. Our project was to develop a hypothetical vaccine for malaria, by performing bioinformatic epitope analysis on the Plasmodium falciparum genome. The planning phase was also very good, in that we established a set of objectives and neatly laid out a plan which were to be carried out in the execution phase. But the project was a total fiasco because it stopped with the planning phase!We did not proceed to the execution phase at all! I would attribute this failure to our lack of time, lack of a proper supervisor and other work and study commitments. But the primary reason for the failure in my opinion was that it was voluntary and not mandatory.
