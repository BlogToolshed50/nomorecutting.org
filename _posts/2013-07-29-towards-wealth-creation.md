We are living in a paradoxical situation in this world. While one sector of the people and region are languishing in poverty, the wealthier people are. It is quite interesting to read an article on the subject of amazing wealth. Despite the economic slow down and the turbulence in various nations in the recent times, the situation seems to be looking up now. It is in fact encouraging to see the news that 78% of the world&#8217;s wealthy people are expected to grow at least four times from their present level. The study conducted by the Scorpio partnership and the Standard Chartered Private bank with a sample of 1500 investors proved this fact.

It has also indicated that the wealthy one in the continents of Europe and Asia are aiming high to grow fast from the current level in the range of three to six times. It is one way good that the personal wealth of these groups if grown for their expectation is bound to accelerate the economic growth of the world as a whole. The spending is bound to go up with the increase in individual fortunes resulting in the spin off effect in offering the livelihood too many.
