Solar energy is a safe and renewable energy and help us create a harmless environment. Anyone needs the green energy source can easily achieved it with the help of solar cells to converting the sun’s rays into electricity. The different solar energy source like passive, active are available, people can select it based on their needs.

When we refer to passive solar energy, nothing is converted. What happens is the building’s design helps avoid heat loss and gets the most out of day lighting. 

Such a technique can also be used in homes because studies have shown that this can reduce the heating requirements by as much as 80% with minimal cost. This means you don’t have to turn on the air condition or heater that often and if everyone does that, we don’t consume that much electricity which we get from non-renewable resources.
