In the 60 s the only way to incorporate a robot was to dress up someone and let him undergo all the hardships but with he technology in hand, we can get it done in all shapes and forms using graphics technology.Film industry has clearly supported the evolution of graphics for their needs. There is a gradual growth in how the graphic industry is evolving. It is really a clear evolution that we an see in the graphics industry from the early 60s to what we see today.
