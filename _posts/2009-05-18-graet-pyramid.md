Great Pyramid is the vital attraction to the tourists who visit Egypt. It is located at Giza and is one among the wonders of the world. Built over a period of 35 years it is a mammoth structure one should see. Though the initial height was about 148 meters it is reduced to a level of 137 meters now due to he damage to the top structures. Lime stones weighing about 2 to 9 tons per block were used numbering around 2.5 million to develop this pyramid. The construction was over by 2560BC.. Thus it stands as the tallest man made structure aging little over 3800 years.
