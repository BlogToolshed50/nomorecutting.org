When working to convert your real estate leads into clients, it is important to show appreciation for your leads – nothing will endear you to a homeowner faster. Even if you have been unable to make contact with a particular lead, you should intersperse your normal follow-up with an occasional thank you card or gift just to let your real estate leads know you appreciate their time and consideration.

Too many agents are more worried about getting a check than ensuring their clients&#8217; satisfaction. It doesn&#8217;t take much time or money to show that you see more than dollar signs when you meet with your real estate leads. By spending only $200 or less per month, you can show your gratitude in a way homeowners can appreciate.

Use some of these 5 great ideas to show appreciation for your real estate leads (after all – they ARE the ones who will wind up paying your salary!):

1. Free goodies – you probably print up thousands of calendars, magnets, pens, or bottle openers a year with your name and logo on them. Are you just giving them to current clients? I surely hope not. You&#8217;ve already got their business and by all means, you should DEFINITELY be showing them appreciation, but the little trinkets with your contact information need to be going out to your real estate leads. Everybody can use a magnet, so don&#8217;t be shy about sending free things to ALL your potential customers – better yet, you&#8217;ve got a car, use it – rather then spend money on postage, deliver little gift bags to your real estate leads personally.

2. Gift cards – everybody loves a nice gift card, all the more so when it&#8217;s a totally unexpected surprise. You can spend $100-200 a month to get gift cards in increments of $5 and send them to 20-40 of your real estate leads that seem to have the most potential. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a gift card to anywhere fancy – Blockbuster, Home Depot, a super market, even to an area restaurant – show your real estate leads that you appreciate them even if they HAVEN&#8217;T decided to list with you yet – their time is precious and they didn&#8217;t HAVE to spend it with you, but they did anyway.

3. Tickets to an event – if you know some of your real estate leads really like baseball, or love the theater, you may want to splurge a bit on a pair of tickets. Find a great local show and buy a few tickets or get tickets to the games of your local baseball team (doesn&#8217;t have to be the major leagues) and personally drop them off at your lead&#8217;s house. Make sure the tickets are far enough in advance so the lead can schedule around the event. If you feel fairly confident with the lead, make it a condition that you&#8217;ll take them to the event! A few hours with the lead and you&#8217;ll likely come out of it with a friend and a new client!

4. Stuff for the kids – if you know your real estate leads have kids, use it to your advantage. Put a little gift bag together for the kiddies – nothing too crazy though! Try to stay away from things parents may not want to give their kids, like sweets and candy. Keep it simple – perhaps a children&#8217;s book, or a simple toy like a ball or a yo-yo. Again, not something that will break your bank, but just something to show you&#8217;re thinking not just of the lead, but their family as well. If they don&#8217;t have kids, but do have pets, you may want to look into buying something for Fido – some people treat their pets the same as they would their children!

5. Be crafty – if you&#8217;ve got a creative streak, don&#8217;t be afraid to throw something together (or go online to get gift ideas). For example, one agent I knew made something she referred as Dishtowel Angels. It basically involved a dishtowel and matching pot holder put together with ribbon and wire to resemble an angel. Something like that, or a gift basket with useful tools, or even a nice flower for planting in the front yard can really warm someone up to you. Using something you put together yourself gives it that extra little touch that shows your real estate leads you care.

Those are just five quick and easy things you can do to show your appreciation and hopefully convince your real estate leads that no other agent can give them the kind of attention you can. Take these ideas and run with them, come up with your own gift ideas – especially once you&#8217;ve gotten to know your leads a bit better. Even if you&#8217;ve never talked to them before, but you&#8217;ve driven by their home and noticed them playing with their dog, or gardening out front – use what you know to come up with the perfect way of thanking your real estate leads. It puts you one step closer to turning them into clients!
