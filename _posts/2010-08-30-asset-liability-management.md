Asset liability management is the most vital matter in the banking system. This decides the spread a bank gets which directly add to the profit. If there is mismatch between the asset and the liability of the bank on a particular period or time than it indicates the unhealthy position of the bank. If the assets are on the higher side it will lead to liquidity crunch. If the liability is on the higher side it will drain the profit of the bank. Hence this should be taken care of on an ongoing basis.
