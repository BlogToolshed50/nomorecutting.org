Globalization has lead to the advent of multivariate risks in the matter of lending or in the lender -borrower relationship. Apart from the traditional risk like credit risk new classes of risk elements started emerging.Operational risk, financial risk, management risk , market risk and political risks too had cropped up in various degrees. Economists are compelled to devise the systems to identify , monitor and mitigate such risks to avoid the collapse of the banking system.Recent collapse of many financial institutions in USA like that of Bear stern ,etc,. are the clear example of how the lack of preventing the risk elements systematically will damage the financial sector.
