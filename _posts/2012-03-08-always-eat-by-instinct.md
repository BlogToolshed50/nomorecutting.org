We are worried about our eating habit and the choice of various food items. One type of food or the nutrient becomes a must when it was said to be harmful earlier. Take for instance, the &#8220;fat&#8221; which was advocated to be avoided completely at obey stage according to everyone, but the theory changed with time that, we are advised to take fat like &#8220;omega 3, which is found to be beneficial to health according to the experts in recent studies. Hence, the food that was considered &#8220;bad&#8221; at one point need to be taken at a different time.

By convention there is no such things as &#8220;good food &#8220;or &#8220;bad food&#8221; as we come to know in various studies and experience. Even certain super healthy foods claimed to be the best food like turnips can be lethal if eaten too much since they are said to contain Psoralens. You may surprise to know that even excess water is damaging to the health of any one. Likewise any food that is taken in excess may be harmful to human health and you try to eat according to the direction of your instinct to remain health
