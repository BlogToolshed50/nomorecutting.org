Birthday celebrations are becoming very common. Earlier not everyone used to celebrate birthdays. Now a days, around the world people celebrate birthdays. This has made a birthday look like a common occurrence. But for the person who is celebrating his/her birthday, the day comes once in a year. So for them, it is a very important day. What is the way to make your friends and family feel good on their birthdays? Let us find out.

Your wish on a birthday should make the recipient feel happy and important. He/she should feel that your wishes are coming from your heart and there is nothing casual about them. Even if you are not sending a gift, a card is good enough, provided it manages to convey what you mean. For a moment put yourself in his/her position. For them, it is a very important day. It is the day they were born. It is a day that holds very special meaning for them. Many of us try and find out who else was born on our birthdays. We feel connected with people born on our birthday. Therefore please make sure that your wishes are heart felt. That is the reason why selection of a right card becomes very important.

If the person you are sending your wishes accesses the Internet, then an e-card is a very good option. An e-card or e-greeting card looks better than a printed card because it can be animated. One can see lot of movement in the e-card, which is not possible with printed cards. But the e-card should fit the person to whom you are sending it. For a female recipient, choose muted colors. For elderly persons, chose muted earth colors. For children chose bright colors and for others choose appropriate colors. Look at the animation carefully. Except to children, avoid sending cards with cartoons, as they are becoming very common. Send e-cards with theme of nature &#8211; flowers, waterfalls, rivers, oceans, mountains etc. Read the text carefully. If you were to receive the card, how you would have felt reading the text? Choose the text carefully so that it conveys your heart felt wishes. Let the recipient feel that the e-card was selected after lot of deliberation.
