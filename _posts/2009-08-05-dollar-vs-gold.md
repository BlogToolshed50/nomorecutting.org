Dollar vs Gold is the latest observation made in the international trade. When the Dollar is strengthening the investors shun gold. At the same time, the relationship between the price of crude and that of gold is also significantly interrelated as seen from the movement of the price of both. Of late when ever the oil price is decreasing, the gold price too comes down. The latest theory is that Gold will track oil price almost a dollar for dollar. When the dollar is strengthening against almost all the other major currencies like euro and pound sterling, the gold price begun to react in the opposite direction.
