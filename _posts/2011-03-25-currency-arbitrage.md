Currency arbitrage refers to the difference in the value of a particular currency of a country in the home land and abroad. This normally happens owing to the supply demand mismatch of the said currency in a particular country. Certain international financial institutions and the banks take advantage of this value difference and do the arbitrage to gain the profit. They purchase in the market where the currency is of less value and sell it overseas at a premium . Here the delivery of the actual currency is not involved. Hence the currency arbitrage helps the traders to get reasonable profit.
