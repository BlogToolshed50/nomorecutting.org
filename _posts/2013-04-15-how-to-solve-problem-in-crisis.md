Ask for another example of what the students think crisis. With the help of the students, discuss why it is hard to make decisions during crisis. To start with, choices that needs to be made tend to be harder to make. This might be why a person is in crisis. They have put off creation a tough decision or solving a problem until it was an urgent situation. One example is not deciding to go to see the doctor for minor fever and cough until the fever and cough are unbearable. Another problem with making decisions in a disaster is people tend to be emotional; making decisions during a disaster is that they often want to be made in rush. This leaves not as much of time to develop possible solutions. Discuss other factors that the students add. Review some important strategies for crisis management.

Be Prepared for bad days, a person can&#8217;t be prepared for all the things. However, some of these suggestions should assist. Collect some money in your saving account to prepare for the possibility of losing a job or making an emergency purchase. Keep some reserve money at home for an emergency. Keep a spare tire, jumper cables, and other important equipment in your car.
