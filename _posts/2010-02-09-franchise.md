Franchise is the new method of inorganic growth aimed by many business houses to expand their business . Franchise helps them to improve the turnover in an easy way . The investment and the capital required is restricted in the case of franchising where, the other party is also compelled to invest in the business. The established technology and the marketing strategy alone is passed on and the infrastructure requirement is taken care by the third party. The profit sharing by way of franchising is decided in advance.
