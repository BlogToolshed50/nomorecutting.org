What is a Bookmarklet? And Other Cool News from Adjix

(Carlsbad, CA) &#8212; Adjix, a new online advertising network that launched seven weeks ago, has created a powerful new tool on its “link-shrinking” website at www.adjix.com. The new feature, affectionately named a Bookmarklet, gives Adjix users (&#8220;Linkers&#8221;) the ability to shrink a web link in a single click directly from their web browser regardless if it is Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari – this feature works on Windows, Mac OS X, and the iPhone. With Bookmarklets, there&#8217;s no need to copy, paste, and visit the Adjix website each time when shortening a URL. Adjix has posted video tutorials detailing how Bookmarklets work.

Adjix shares ad revenues, from simple text ads embedded at the top of each page, with Linkers each time someone clicks on a link they have shortened. Advertisers like the precise targeting, transparent pricing, and detailed link click data Adjix gives them, and Linkers have enjoyed the option of earning money from their blogs, text messages, and e-mails. Additionally, based on user feedback, Adjix now offers linkers an “ad-free” option, too, when shrinking a link. Even with the ad-free option, Linkers still get detailed link click data.

Users can receive very detailed reports of exactly who clicked on their links and how many times they have been clicked, something not available from other link-shrinking services. “We just implemented a new feature that lets users specify their time zone, as well,” notes Joe Moreno, founder and president of Adjix. “We’re also excited about the Adjix API which lets third parties directly interface with Adjix when shrinking links.”

When Adjix launched in August 2008 it received world wide attention. The Adjix system is built using the same technology that Apple uses to run its iTunes Store and its online stores through out the world. For more information on Adjix, visit www.adjix.com.
