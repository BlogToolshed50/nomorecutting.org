Java scripts are embedded into everything that you can imagine on the internet.Java was developed by the sun corporation . Java runs on a JVM platform and is absolutely not related to java scripts. java scripts on the other hand is just another scripting language that just does more than you would expect it to do.Its wide spread usage has really stood besides it for becoming so much popular.I think that the world of java scripts will not die as long as internet prevails over the earth.
