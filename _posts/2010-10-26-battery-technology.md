I wonder how the battery technology is still not able to keep up with the development of electronics.The marketing factor of many models of laptop in the market these days are the battery life.One of the most important requirement of having a good laptop is a good battery life. My lenovo thinkpad promises around 7 hours of time but it just manages to give around 4 hours.This is one of the best available in the market today, Hopefully markets come up with better battery technology in future.This is the problem faced by most electronic industries these days.
