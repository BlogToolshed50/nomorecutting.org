Contact pesticide is a type of pesticides that are used in plant protection. This is used to prevent the pests form attacking the crops. The contact pesticides are of the nature that they will kill the insects when they are coming in touch with them . The contact pesticides when sprayed on the crops get deposited on the surface of the crop parts. They contain the chemicals that are harmful to the insects that may damage the plants. They are mild in nature when compared to the systemic pesticides. When ever we eat food items fresh from the field it is better to wash them to remove the chemicals and eat it.
