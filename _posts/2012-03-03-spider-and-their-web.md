Every living creature has its own peculiar character in this world. When I read an article on the spider, it was quite interested to note that they do not stick to their own webs. The reason attributed to this aspect was the non sticking chemical coating found in their legs. Added to this, they too get their legs covered with the branching hairs which easily protect them. Various latest studies on these types of living creatures have revealed different kinds of such special features possessed by them which remain as the reason for their actions.

In fact the study conducted on the behavior of two tropical species of spider namely, Nephila Clavipes and Gasteracantha Cancriformis by the University of Costa Rica came out with the above findings. They also found that individual droplets of sticky glue slide along the legs bristly hair of the spider. The researchers have found that the spiders carefully move their legs in such a way that it is able to minimize the adhesive forces during their movement while building the web to avoid sticking to the web. It is the endowment by the nature on these creatures to help them to guard against the difficulties.
