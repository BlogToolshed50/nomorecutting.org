Sudden Infant Death Syndrome has become the reason for the death of older infants now a days. Using the blanket to cover the head at the time of sleeping too is found to be the main reason for such sudden death. The heat generated in the body while sleeping reaches the head region at the time of sleeping and the brain gets heated resulting in the death. Also the supply of oxygen gets reduced, while covering the head ,resulting in the death. It is up to the parents to teach them these aspects and make them to avoid such practice.
