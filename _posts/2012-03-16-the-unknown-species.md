The list of unknown species in the universe is a matter of curiosity to every one of us. Despite the spate of researches and the various expeditions to bring out the list of unknown species, there found to be no end for this subject. The recent surveys by a team from Oxford and Southampton universities and the British Antarctic survey has found colonies of marine life, including crabs, an Octopus and starfish totally new to science, living in the turkey depths of nearly 8000 feet deep under the sea.

Kept alive by the under sea volcanoes, these unknown species live in complete darkness by taking their energy from braking down highly toxic chemicals found in the smoke from the volcanoes. It is a wonder to observe such life in a hostile environment according to the survey team from University of Oxford. Apart from the &#8220;yetri crab&#8221;, the team could find out seven armed starfish and clusters of snails at this depth during their survey. We can conclude that we are still to explore the entire universe and the numerous living creatures under its cover.
