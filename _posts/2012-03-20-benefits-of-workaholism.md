For me it sounds unacceptable when someone says that Workaholism brings well-being in a person. But the recent article which I stumbled upon disproves my popular faith stating that, workaholics are likely to display vigor and dedication. They never undergo the exhaustion and cynicism. According to professor Baruch, from Rouen Business School, Workaholism should not be construed as a negative phenomenon.

As his argument, Workaholism does not result in high-level of stress interfering with work life balance. Also, it needs not be treated as a negative addiction leading to depression at some stage. In fact, the workaholics are found to get energized by their work and their achievements reinforce a sense of well-being as surveyed in many. If the Workaholism does not deteriorate the health of a person, it is better that we leave to them to decide how much to work.
