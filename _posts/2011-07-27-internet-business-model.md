Once I was on a business visit to a remote countryside,where I did not have any Internet connection.That was when I felt that without an Internet connection having a computer is absolutely of no use.I&#8217;m sure that most of you reading this article would agree to this.These days, I do most of my work online,and just about everything in the world is accessible through the Internet.A better business model in the world of Internet is to charge per use than one time sale.This is how most of the subscription websites thrive online these days.I&#8217;m planning to start a subscription website myself in the near future.
