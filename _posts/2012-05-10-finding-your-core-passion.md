&#8221; Unhappiness comes from attempting to be who we are not; the journey of life is to gain clarity about who you really are . . . so that you can be your authentic self. &#8221; &#8211; Jack Altschuler

Ever wonder why they say &#8220;play your strengths&#8221; in every aspect of life? The adage comes from a belief that every individual has something unique about them that sets them apart from everyone else.

Finding ones core purpose and managing to enhance and polish it not only makes for a happier and healthier life but guarantees success.

Theory of Morph:- An interesting philosophy behind the concept of core is the Theory of Morph. The theory states that the potential of a person is determined as soon as the foetus is born in the mother&#8217;s womb.

The theory elaborates that the core of a person depends upon which part of the foetus is foremost formed. It could be born first with either its head torso or limbs.

Babies born with the head (nervous system, skin, nails etc) first are known as Ectomorph. They are said to have large foreheads and are essentially known to be intellectuals and prefer to deal with matters of the logic and brain.

These people are thinkers, capable of analyzing complex data and arriving at conclusive inferences.

Some babies are born with the torso (stomach, intestines and heart) first. These are called Endomorphs and have a tendency to be broader or rotund around the middle.

They are known to possess great emotional intelligence and have the ability to empathize with a variety of people. They understand human dynamics and can solve conflicts easily.

Babies which are born with their limb first are called Mesomorph and their intelligence is purely physical.

They have perfect hand-eye coordination and are envied for their physique and abundant energy. Their forte lies in anything where physical strength and operational decision making is required.

This theory doesn&#8217;t imply we need to ask our doctors how we were born. It simply stresses on the fact that we all possess a specific trait that helps us excel in whatever we undertake.

Your core:- Coming to the most important question&#8230;.. What is your core? It is a specific purpose with which you really connect on a deeper level and which comes about effortlessly.

A core purpose will absorb you completely to the extent that you are oblivious of all that is around you.

Only, when you use something you are really great at and apply it towards what you really care about with relentless passion does the magic happen and the adventure ultimately begins.

In short, your physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual being come together in that activity.

Jack Canfield, in his book The Success Principles stated, &#8220;I believe you have inside you a core genius… some one thing that you love to do, and do so well, that you hardly feel like doing anything else. It&#8217;s effortless for you and a whole lot of fun. And if you could make money doing it, you&#8217;d make it your lifetime&#8217;s work.&#8221;

&#8220;Successful people believe this, too. That&#8217;s why they put their core genius first. They focus on it—and delegate everything else to other people on their team.&#8221;

Identify your core:- When we say &#8220;play your strengths&#8221;, the implication is to unleash that core competency within you which will take your performance to a higher level.

Individuals dealing with their core are seen at their best, they derive immense pleasure, satisfaction and fun not known to them any other way.

The Money Times urges to use the Morph theory to understand what lies at the core of your being. If you can figure out the purpose of your life, you will have leveraged your core and success will be around the corner.
