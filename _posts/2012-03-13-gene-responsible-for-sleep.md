I recently came to know from a news item that people who sleep for even four hours remain alert in the rest of the time and attend to their work. In fact, the scientists have identified the gene that is responsible for controlling the length of time a person sleeps. The gene is called ABCC9 according to the study by University of Munich.

The researchers discovered that people who had two copies of one common variant of ABCC9 slept for significantly shorter time than those with two copies of another version. The research team were able to modify the gene to shorten the length of the sleep in the animal. As such, the day may not be far-off, when the scientists can alter the gene to shorten or lengthen the sleeping time and yet make the people remain alert.
