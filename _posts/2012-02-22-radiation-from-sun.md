In-spite of the various environmental safeguard measures followed worldwide, the exploitation of the nature by the humans is leading to be unexpected disasters. The recent powerful radiation as we come across from the sun on the earth is an indication that we need to have more restraint in dealing with the nature. I read an article indicating the biggest coronal mass ejection by Sun a few days ago which had delivered a powerful punch on the earth&#8217;s magnetic field. Added to that a strong solar flare was also reported as a follow on effect of the radiation.

According to the scientists of University of New Hampshire, the powerful radiation from the Sun was due to both the existing population of energetic particles launched by the first coronal mass ejection and a powerful magnetic connection. They have reeled particles towards the earth from the Sun&#8217;s blast region as revealed by the scientists. The energetic particles are capable of sneaking around the &#8216;corner&#8217; as confirmed by the researchers at UNH institute for the study of earth, Oceans, and Space. In all it is imperative that we closely observe such happening and take preventive measures to ensure the safety of the earth.
