Many findings are coming out regarding the cause of mass extinction on earth which would have happened billions of years ago. According to the scientists, the Gamma ray burst from a colossal group of stars must have caused the mass extinction on earth around 440 million years earlier. The German researchers from Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics have come out with they said findings recently.

According to the researcher, the globular cluster hosts many pairs of dead stars that might merge. Depending upon the number of such star clusters and the Gama ray bursts in them, the study had estimated that one such burst must have exploded within the striking distance of the earth leading to the mass extinction. In fact, the European Space Agency is aiming to send a star mapper in 2013 to help in tracking the guilty cluster down. Such explorations are bound to bring out substantial facts to prove the contention of the scientists for many such happening on earth.
