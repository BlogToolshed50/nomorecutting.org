An article on the life forms found kilometers below the ocean&#8217;s deepest volcanic vents is something incredible. Various life forms are found to thrive near sore hot under water geysers as revealed during the recent study of under water life. Can you believe that you can come across the eyeless shrimps and white tentacled anemones bunched around the cracks in the ocean at a temperature of 450 degree Celsius?.Yes, they thrive at such toughest atmospheric heat according to the exploration by marine Geo-chemist of Britain&#8217;s National Oceanography Center.

According to their findings done through the deep diving robot submarine they have confirmed the presence of such rare life forms withstanding the vagaries of climate and heat. The shrimps found at these levels are lacking normal eyes, but are having the light sensing organ on their backs to assist them to navigate in the deep sea vents. It is a mystery unresolved regarding these animals as to how they are able to disperse from one vent field to another crossing very large distances.
