Searching for a school or college can be a time consuming and confusing time and knowing which ones to apply for and then which one to accept can be difficult ad even a little traumatic. But there are many ways of minimizing both the time taken and the confusion involved so that the process is a little less stressful.

Firstly you need to decide whether you want to attend school or college in your own area or state, or whether you are prepared to move to another location; and if so, how far you are prepared to relocate. Of course, your test scores may preclude some choice in this matter. You also need to have some idea of what you can afford some colleges are more expensive than others and some offer payment plans and scholarships while others do not.

Then talk to your current schools career adviser to seek their counsel and see what they have to say. They may recommend some schools above others as they may be more suited to your needs, talents and situation and overall career ambition.

The next thing to do is get online. There are many web sites on the Internet where you can enter information, such as your region, annual cost preference, freshman year class size preference, preference regarding the size of the surrounding community, and school type (public or private) they are then processed in a database and the site spits out a series of school recommendations. Other sites offer tips and strategies for obtaining scholarships and paying for college. Another web site allows you to register for a SAT Program test and send the results to various colleges and scholarship programs. 

A Google entry for school/college search will give you more than 660,000 results. Some results are region or specialty specific for instance there is a web site devoted to assisting you to find the right college at which to complete your MBA. Some sites are quite possibly not as legitimate or as thorough as others. There are a myriad to choose from. Which ever school you choose, using the World Wide Web to guide your search for a college or school will definitely make it an easier, less time-consuming and hopefully a far less confusing task.
