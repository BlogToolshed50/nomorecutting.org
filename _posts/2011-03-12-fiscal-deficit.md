Fiscal Deficit of the nation reflects the health of the nation in general. This is the difference between the total revenue receipt of the country and the total expenditure as per the budget. The total revenue may fall short of the target due to less tax collection. This will result in the deficit . hence every nation is trying to increase the total revenue through the stringent tax collection to ensure that the fiscal deficit is kept at the minimum. To meet out the fiscal deficit certain countries circulate the currency which will increase the inflation.
