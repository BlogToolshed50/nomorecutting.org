Of late we are coming across lots of researches which reveal the presence of life in various planets around us. NASA scientists are on the look out through the latest gadgets to confirm the presence of life at Venus. The recent revelation corroborated by the Soviet probe 30 years ago confirms the presence of mysterious lives on Venus. In fact, the Russian space experts claimed to have found out life on Venus during 1982.

On the contrary there are findings to suggest that the revelation by the Russian scientists need a re- look while the Russians suggest that the objects&#8217; morphological features would allow them to say that they are living creatures on Venus. According to NASA scientists, the image found in the photo taken by the Russian is nothing but &#8216;noise&#8217; in a digital image and need not construed as the life on Venus. Though the mystery remains about the life on Venus, the continued exploration by the space scientists is certain to bring out the true picture of such mysterious life on Venus.
