Nuclear Power is used in the power sector in various countries to certain extent as the basic raw material Uranium is a scarce one and the supply of the same is controlled by the Nuclear Supply Group. Country like France is producing about 70% of the country&#8217;s power requirement from the nuclear power plants. Though they term it as cheap in the absence of other sources to meet out the needed power, it has certain disadvantages. Disposal of the nuclear wastes from these plant is a very difficult process and they are causing health problem. Most of the countries are finding it difficult to dump such nuclear waste as the radiation from the same affects the locality in and around. Hence, they are seriously thinking about the alternative source of energy and also plan to reduce the power consumption.
