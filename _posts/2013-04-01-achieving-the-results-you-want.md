The practice of goal setting is very popular and is done by many people. The purpose of setting goals is so that you can achieve a specific desired result. Whatever that result is, is merely a matter of preference among the individual.

There are a lot of diverse kind of goals you can set for yourself. Many include health, spiritual, family, and financial. These are all great types of goals to achieve strive for. The problem is that many people will set them, but never meet them.

The goals you set for yourself should be able to help you have a better life and be better off. You could already be in a pretty good position or you could be struggling. Whatever you situation you can set goals to become even better. If you want to better your financial situation you should set a goal and a deadline on what that would be achieved.

The most prominent time of the year for someone to make a goal would be on January 1. It gives you that sense of a second chance and a new start. These are usually referred to as resolutions. Although the new year is a good time to set goals, it should not necessarily be the only time. But again, if you are lucky enough you will be able to keep those resolutions for a few weeks before you do something that might screw them up and then you give up and not focus on it anymore.

When setting goals for yourself you should also have someone that you are accountable to. This can be anyone from a spouse to a friend or even a business partner. Accountability is important because without that you are more likely to fail and quit when things get tough. This person will help you stay on track and be focused.

The action that you take on your goals must happen immediately. You will not have success in life if you do not take action now and begin your journey. You must stop procrastinating and take action now. Success is only a decision away.
