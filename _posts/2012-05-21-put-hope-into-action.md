Children hope to have good relations with others. Young people hope to get into a good university and get a stable job after graduation. Older people hope that they will be rich, that they stay healthy, that their children will have good lives. People hope for different things at different times in lives.

Hope is a state of our mind. Hope is the desire for something good in the future. It has the capability to change our lives and makes us possible to see a future in which we are willing to participate. Albert Barnes, a great Christian commentator, writes: Where there is a strong desire for an object and a corresponding expectation of obtaining it which constitutes true hope then we can wait with patience.

Hebrews 11:1 Hope without faith is only a wish. When I hope that my daughter will get into a good university, I have faith that God will bring it about. I hoped for my wife to get an easier job, and I had faith that God would provide it. I believe that my hope for my daughter will happen, because I have faith that God will work in her life. We need to have faith in God and believe that what we hope for will happen.

Treasure your imaginations and your dreams as they are the origin of your hope, the sketches of your ultimate accomplishments. A keen throbbing hope which transcends everything is the rising point of all accomplishments. When your hopes are strong enough you will appear to have supernatural powers to put your hope into action and make it into reality.

Create a definite plan for carrying out your hope and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Before success in one&#8217;s hope he is sure to meet with many temporary setbacks and, perhaps, some failure. Don&#8217;t be disappointed if you fail a few times. When a setback comes, accept it as a signal that your plans need rebuild, and set course once more toward your coveted hope.

Edison failed 10,000 times before he made the electric light. Action with patience, persistence and perspiration is the real measure of intelligence. Life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better results you get. Most of the important things in the world have been achieved by people who have kept on trying when it seemed to be no hope at all.

Just as our eyes need light in order to see, our hopes need actions in order to become reality. The dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow. You might remember that nothing can bring you accomplishment but yourself. Life is a do-it-yourself project. If you do not want to do great things, do small things in a great way. &#8220;Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness.&#8221; said Napoleon Hill.

Sir Winston Churchill once said &#8220;All great things are simple, and many can be expressed in single words: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope&#8221;. The past is a derivation of knowledge, and the future is a derivation of hope. Love of the past infers hope in the future. Hope is a basis in every condition as there&#8217;s life there&#8217;s hope. Let us hope that we are all headed in this world by a story of faith, hope and love. And let&#8217;s put it into action.
