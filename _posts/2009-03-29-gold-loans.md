The redemption is allowed after the entire loan is paid back by the borrower. In case of default the gold is auctioned and the proceed is appropriated to extinguish the liability.Many rural population in the poor countries mainly depend on this source of funding to tide over their financial difficulty as they are unable to borrow from the banking sector like the affluent society which could offer the requisite security to borrow.
