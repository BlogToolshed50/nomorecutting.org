Matlab is a great academic software. It is really costly but really helps students and researchers in performing their daily research. Matlab can perform matrix operations really easily. It is amazing how such a product was developed on Java platform. Since Java is slower, a C implementation could have been really faster. But due to the ability to work with good debugging, matlab is still maintained as a java based software!!
