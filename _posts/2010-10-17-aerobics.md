I have seen people performing aerobics and it is truly amazing.There are many type of aerobics like dance aerobics, step aerobics, power step aerobics, aqua aerobics and regular aerobics.I decided to take step classes. Now, its my fifth week of class and week by week, its getting real fun! The best part is the music that is being played. When you donâ€™t loose your rhythm and co-ordinate and synchronize your steps with the music, then it can be real fun!But a caveat to keep in mind is that its an intense workout and people who have not done any exercise in the near pas, should not get too much into it at the first go. They should gradually increase their workout time till they get comfortable.
