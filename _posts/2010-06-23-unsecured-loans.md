Unsecured loans are those loans which are clean in nature. Banks at times go in for the loans which will not have any security. It is in fact very risky to go in for the unsecured loans in large quantum But it is also inevitable as all the corporates may not be able to offer the securities matching the huge quantum of funds that is financed by the banks. They should be lent on clean terms also in view of the reputation of the company in the industry.
