Cropping intensity is to be increased to improve the food production to feed the increasing population.The land availability is restricted and the only way to improve the agricultural production is to use the available land in a better manner. In normal circumstances the land usage is to the extent of 100%. Where as by judicious use and proper crop combination the cropping intensity can even be raised to the level of 300%A long term crop coupled with two short term crop in an acre of land in a year will easily improve the cropping intensity to the estimated level of 300%. The tested combination is two cereal crops along with a pulse crop of a short duration is practiced in many parts of the world to ensure better use of the land at our disposal.
