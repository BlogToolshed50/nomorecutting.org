Banking sector world over is undergoing a period of strain. After the collapse of Lehman brothers, the impact was so much that the global economy was derailed. Failure of good number of banks in the USA after the sub prime crisis confirmed the fact that all is not well in the banking sector. I read in a news item that as much as 14 banks are being closed in the USA every month.

As of now about 775 banks are reported to be at the high risk category indicating the possibility of folding them sooner or latter. The recent warning from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the USA clearly indicates that more failures are expected very soon.

To the contrary, the banking sector in the developing nations are found to be healthy when compared to the developed country like the USA. The failure on the part of regulators to control the banking activity is reported to be the prime reason. The increased default due to the increase in the unemployment is also found to be the reason for the failure of many banks.

During the first quarter of 2010 as many as 41 banks were closed in the USA. In 2009 around 140 banks went out of stream putting the economy at risk in the USA. Unless the regulators come out with proper systems to monitor the baning activity into an ongoing basis the collapse of banks in the future cannot be averted.
