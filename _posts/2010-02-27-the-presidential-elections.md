There is the buzz about this years presidential election. I am not too much of a follower but still I&#8217;d be interested to know who stands the test ultimately. As some one on the news said &#8220;it does not matter who comes next as long as the current fools are out of office&#8221;. Now that seems something really true though I am not against any US policies at this moment just because it does not directly affect my life in any way. You really need to think about all this if your daily life is being affected by their stands. As far as I am concern a new change will be definitely welcome but I still doubt anything new and happening change that might come along with it.
