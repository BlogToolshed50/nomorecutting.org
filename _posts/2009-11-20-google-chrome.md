Google chrome, if you did not know is the new browser that was introduced by google as opensource. Now the question is , firefox is a similat open source browser that was always being finded by google. Now the speculation with most experts is the relationship between google and firefox for the future. This is a great challenge that will come to google to decide their support. Will it support their newly rolled out browser or keep supporting the people&#8217;s browser.
