I recently visited my friend who lives in Washington. It is a state that is really famous for its apples all over the world. This is my first visit to that place and I really love being there.I got to pluck apples from the trees and eat then right where I plucked. It is wonderful to get closer to nature this way. I can now imagine how it&#8217;ll be to live a jungle life eating these fruits everyday!!
