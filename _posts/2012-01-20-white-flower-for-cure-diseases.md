What may come in the form of modern drugs, the role of medicinal plants cannot be underestimated in the field of curing various diseases. I have recently read in an article that a rare white flower found in the snow capped mountains in China can supposedly bring the dead back to life. The scientists at Shanghai and Hong Kong are examining this wrinkly flower to make the drugs that can fight against the irregular heart beat. They certify that such drugs from these rare flowers may not lead to any side-effects.

Scientists are experimenting these traditional roots and herbs through clinical tests to find out the medicines that can be accepted around the world. According to them, these flowers can be used to treat range of illness. The key ingredient called acacetin is found to be playing the vital role in fighting against the irregular heart beat. Maybe, we may expect such herb based medicines in-plenty in the days to come to lead a healthy life.
