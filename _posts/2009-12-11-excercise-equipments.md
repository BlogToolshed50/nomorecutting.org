Which is the best way to exercise ? whether it is recommended to undergo weight training or just natural exercises. If if you are looking just to keep your body fit then natural exercises like walking and jogging are your best bet. These exercises will keep you fit an healthy whil not increasing your physique exceptionally. This is also best if you are a casual fitness lover. Only in cases when you really want to develop the shape of your body phenomenally well, you can go ahead for some weight training with hydraulic machines. Until it is really necessary I would recommend you to stick with floor exercises and natural exercises.
